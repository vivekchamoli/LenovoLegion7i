# Feature Flags Environment Variable Fix - v6.2.0

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Issue**: Features reverting to default values and not persisting changes
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Problem Description

Users reported that features in the "AI/ML Performance System" and "Autonomous Multi-Agent System" sections were:
1. Reverting to default values on application load
2. Not persisting changes when toggled
3. All showing the same state within their groups

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Scope Mismatch Bug

**The Problem:**
- **Saving**: Used `EnvironmentVariableTarget.User` scope (writes to registry)
- **Reading**: Used default scope (reads from Process memory only)

```csharp
// BEFORE (OptimizationsControl.xaml.cs:354)
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_ADAPTIVEFANCURVES", "true", EnvironmentVariableTarget.User);

// BEFORE (FeatureFlags.cs:101)
var envVar = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable($"LLT_FEATURE_{name.ToUpperInvariant()}");
// ^ This reads from Process scope only!
```

**What Happened:**
1. User toggles feature → Saves to User scope (registry: `HKCU\Environment`)
2. Application reads feature flag → Reads from Process scope (current process memory)
3. User scope changes not visible to current process until app restart
4. UI appears to revert immediately after toggling

---

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Read from Multiple Scopes (FeatureFlags.cs)

Updated `GetFlag()` to read from all environment variable scopes in priority order:

```csharp
private static bool GetFlag(string name, bool defaultValue)
{
    var envVarName = $"LLT_FEATURE_{name.ToUpperInvariant()}";

    // Check Process scope first (for temporary overrides)
    var envVar = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(envVarName, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);

    // Then check User scope (persistent settings - REGISTRY)
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(envVar))
        envVar = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(envVarName, EnvironmentVariableTarget.User);

    // Finally check Machine scope (system-wide settings)
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(envVar))
        envVar = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(envVarName, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Machine);

    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(envVar))
        return defaultValue;

    return bool.TryParse(envVar, out var value) ? value : defaultValue;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reads from User scope (registry) so persisted changes are visible
- Supports Process scope overrides for testing
- Supports Machine scope for system-wide deployment

### Fix 2: Update Both Scopes When Saving (OptimizationsControl.xaml.cs)

Updated toggle event handlers to set both User and Process scope:

```csharp
// Enable adaptive fan curves
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_ADAPTIVEFANCURVES", "true", EnvironmentVariableTarget.User);   // Persist
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_ADAPTIVEFANCURVES", "true", EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process); // Immediate

// Disable adaptive fan curves
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_ADAPTIVEFANCURVES", "false", EnvironmentVariableTarget.User);   // Persist
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_ADAPTIVEFANCURVES", "false", EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process); // Immediate
```

**Benefits:**
- User scope: Changes persist across application restarts
- Process scope: Changes take effect immediately in current session
- No application restart required to see changes

## How Feature Controls Work

### UI Control Types

There are **two types of controls** for features:

#### 1. Runtime Controls (Start/Stop)
**Location**: `Autonomous Multi-Agent System` card
**Control**: Master toggle switch "Enable Orchestrator"
**What it does**: Starts/stops the orchestrator at runtime
**Persistence**: Controlled by lifecycle manager, not environment variables
**File**: `OrchestratorDashboardControl.xaml`

#### 2. Feature Flag Controls (Enable/Disable)
**Location**: `AI/ML Performance System` card → "Thermal Management" section
**Control**: Toggle switch for "Adaptive Fan Curves"
**What it does**: Enables/disables features via environment variables
**Persistence**: Saved to registry via `EnvironmentVariableTarget.User`
**File**: `OptimizationsControl.xaml`

### Features and Their Control Methods

| Feature | Default | UI Control | Control Method |
|---------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **AI/ML Intelligence** |
| ML Power Predictor | Disabled | ❌ None | Environment variable only |
| Adaptive Fan Curves | Disabled | ✅ Toggle | Toggle in Thermal Management section |
| **Resource Management** |
| Object Pooling | Disabled | ❌ None | Environment variable only |
| Reactive Sensors | Disabled | ❌ None | Environment variable only |
| **Multi-Agent System** |
| Resource Orchestrator | **Enabled** | ✅ Master Toggle | Orchestrator toggle (runtime only) |
| Thermal Agent | **Enabled** | ✅ Master Toggle | Orchestrator toggle (runtime only) |
| Power Agent | **Enabled** | ✅ Master Toggle | Orchestrator toggle (runtime only) |
| GPU Agent | **Enabled** | ✅ Master Toggle | Orchestrator toggle (runtime only) |
| Battery Agent | **Enabled** | ✅ Master Toggle | Orchestrator toggle (runtime only) |
| Hybrid Mode Agent | **Enabled** | ❌ None | Environment variable only |
| Display Agent | **Enabled** | ❌ None | Environment variable only |
| Keyboard Light Agent | **Enabled** | ❌ None | Environment variable only |

---

## How to Control Features

### Method 1: UI Toggle (Adaptive Fan Curves Only)

1. Open Legion Toolkit
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Expand "AI / ML Performance System" card
4. Expand "Thermal Management" section
5. Toggle the switch on/off
6. **Changes take effect immediately** (no restart required)

### Method 2: Environment Variables (All Features)

#### Using Command Prompt (Admin):

```cmd
REM Enable AI/ML features
setx LLT_FEATURE_MLAICONTROLLER true
setx LLT_FEATURE_ADAPTIVEFANCURVES true
setx LLT_FEATURE_REACTIVESENSORS true
setx LLT_FEATURE_OBJECTPOOLING true

REM Disable Multi-Agent features (not recommended for v6.2.0)
setx LLT_FEATURE_RESOURCEORCHESTRATOR false
setx LLT_FEATURE_THERMALAGENT false
setx LLT_FEATURE_POWERAGENT false
setx LLT_FEATURE_GPUAGENT false
setx LLT_FEATURE_BATTERYAGENT false

REM Enable additional agents
setx LLT_FEATURE_HYBRIDMODEAGENT true
setx LLT_FEATURE_DISPLAYAGENT true
setx LLT_FEATURE_KEYBOARDLIGHTAGENT true
```

**Note**: After setting environment variables manually, **restart the application** to see changes.

#### Using PowerShell (Admin):

```powershell
# Enable AI/ML features
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_MLAICONTROLLER", "true", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_ADAPTIVEFANCURVES", "true", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_REACTIVESENSORS", "true", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LLT_FEATURE_OBJECTPOOLING", "true", "User")
```

#### Check Current Values:

```cmd
REM View all LLT feature flags
set LLT_FEATURE_
```

## Default Values Explanation

### Why All Features in Same Group Show Same State

This is **intentional design** for production readiness:

#### Multi-Agent System (v6.2.0) - All **ENABLED** by Default
- These features are **production-ready** as of v6.2.0
- Extensively tested and stable
- Enabled by default for all users
- Display as "Active ✓ (2Hz)" in green

#### AI/ML Performance (Experimental) - All **DISABLED** by Default
- These features are **experimental/opt-in**
- Require additional testing and tuning
- Disabled by default to prevent unexpected behavior
- Display as "Disabled" in gray

**Source**: `LenovoLegionToolkit.Lib\Utils\FeatureFlags.cs` lines 49-91

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Adaptive Fan Toggle Persistence ✅

1. Open Legion Toolkit
2. Navigate to Dashboard → AI/ML Performance System
3. Expand "Thermal Management"
4. Toggle "Enable Adaptive Fan Curves" ON
5. Verify status changes to "Active ✓" immediately
6. Close and restart application
7. Verify toggle is still ON and status shows "Active ✓"

**Expected**: Toggle state persists across restarts

### Test 2: Environment Variable Reading ✅

```cmd
REM Set a feature flag manually
setx LLT_FEATURE_REACTIVESENSORS true

REM Restart Legion Toolkit

REM Check OptimizationsControl → Performance Features
REM Expected: Reactive Sensors shows "Active ✓"
```

### Test 3: Immediate Effect (No Restart) ✅

1. Toggle "Adaptive Fan Curves" ON in UI
2. Observe "Performance Features" section updates immediately
3. "Adaptive Fan Curves" status changes from "Disabled" to "Active ✓"
4. Feature count updates (e.g., "5/9" → "6/9")

**Expected**: Changes visible immediately without restart

## Files Modified

1. **LenovoLegionToolkit.Lib\Utils\FeatureFlags.cs**
   - Lines 99-118: Updated `GetFlag()` method
   - Now reads from User/Machine scope in addition to Process scope

2. **LenovoLegionToolkit.WPF\Controls\Dashboard\OptimizationsControl.xaml.cs**
   - Lines 353-355: Updated `AiAdaptiveFanToggle_Checked()`
   - Lines 368-370: Updated `AiAdaptiveFanToggle_Unchecked()`
   - Now sets both User and Process scope for immediate effect

## Technical Details

### Environment Variable Scopes

| Scope | Storage Location | Visibility | Persistence |
|-------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Process** | Process memory | Current process only | Until process exits |
| **User** | Registry `HKCU\Environment` | Current user, all processes | Permanent |
| **Machine** | Registry `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment` | All users | Permanent |

### Reading Priority (After Fix)

1. **Process scope** - Checked first for temporary overrides
2. **User scope** - Checked second for user preferences
3. **Machine scope** - Checked last for system-wide defaults
4. **Code default** - Used if no environment variable found

### Why This Fix Works

**Before Fix:**
```
User toggles → Writes to User scope (registry)
                     ↓
App reads → Reads from Process scope (memory) ← Old value!
                     ↓
User sees old value (appears to revert)
```

**After Fix:**
```
User toggles → Writes to User scope (registry) + Process scope (memory)
                     ↓                                ↓
App reads → Reads from Process scope (memory) ← New value!
       (or) Reads from User scope (registry)   ← New value!
                     ↓
User sees new value immediately
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**

- Existing environment variables in User/Machine scope continue to work
- Process scope overrides still work for testing
- No breaking changes to API
- Default values unchanged

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Most Features Have No UI Controls

**Limitation**: Only "Adaptive Fan Curves" has a UI toggle. Other features require manual environment variable setup.

**Workaround**: Set environment variables via Command Prompt or PowerShell (see "Method 2" above).

**Future Enhancement**: Add toggle switches for all features in OptimizationsControl UI.

### 2. Orchestrator Toggle Controls Runtime, Not Flags

**Limitation**: The "Enable Orchestrator" toggle in `OrchestratorDashboardControl` controls runtime start/stop, not feature flags.

**Clarification**:
- **Runtime toggle** = Starts/stops orchestrator in current session
- **Feature flags** = Enables/disables features permanently

**Expected Behavior**: Even if feature flags are enabled, orchestrator won't run unless runtime toggle is ON.

## Recommendations for v6.2.0+

### For End Users

1. ✅ **Use default settings** - Multi-Agent System is enabled and production-ready
2. ✅ **Enable Orchestrator toggle** in dashboard for autonomous optimization
3. ⚠️ **Experimental features optional** - ML AI, Reactive Sensors are opt-in

### For Advanced Users

1. Enable experimental features via environment variables
2. Monitor battery improvement metrics in dashboard
3. Use "Clear All Learning Data" button if behavior becomes suboptimal

### For Developers

1. Consider adding UI toggles for all feature flags
2. Add "Reset to Defaults" button for feature flags
3. Consider using Settings file instead of environment variables for better UX
