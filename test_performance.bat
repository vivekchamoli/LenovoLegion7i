REM Performance Test Script for Lenovo Legion Toolkit v6.3.2
REM This script launches the application and provides performance monitoring guidance

echo ============================================
echo   Lenovo Legion Toolkit - Performance Test
echo   Version: 6.3.2 (Optimized)
echo ============================================
echo.
echo PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED:
echo   [1] Hardware-accelerated rendering (was: Software-only)
echo   [2] Cached battery data (eliminates UI thread blocking)
echo   [3] Async event handlers (no blocking on slow subscribers)
echo   [4] Reduced polling: Orchestrator 500ms-^>1000ms (50%% reduction)
echo   [5] Reduced polling: Battery 500ms-^>2000ms (75%% reduction)
echo   [6] Smart context caching (eliminates redundant sensor reads)
echo   [7] Conditional post-execution gathering (50%% reduction)
echo   [8] Optimized signal cleanup (periodic vs every-time)
echo.
echo ============================================
echo   EXPECTED PERFORMANCE METRICS
echo ============================================
echo   CPU Usage (Idle):    ^<1%%  (was: 8-15%%)
echo   CPU Usage (Active):  ^<3%%  (was: 15-25%%)
echo   UI Responsiveness:   Instant (was: Laggy/Stuttering)
echo   Memory Usage:        ^<200 MB (stable)
echo.
echo ============================================
echo   TESTING CHECKLIST
echo ============================================
echo.
echo Before starting, open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) to monitor:
echo   - CPU usage
echo   - Memory usage
echo   - GPU usage (if available)
echo.
echo Tests to perform:
echo   [ ] UI launches smoothly without freezing
echo   [ ] Dashboard scrolling is smooth (no stuttering)
echo   [ ] Dashboard updates every 1 second without lag
echo   [ ] Dropdowns/buttons respond instantly
echo   [ ] CPU usage stays ^<3%% during normal use
echo   [ ] No freezing when interacting with controls
echo   [ ] Battery info updates without blocking UI
echo   [ ] Orchestrator runs at 1 Hz (1 cycle/second)
echo.

echo Launching Lenovo Legion Toolkit (Release build)...
echo Monitor Task Manager for CPU/Memory usage...
echo.

REM Launch the application
start "" "LenovoLegionToolkit.WPF\bin\x64\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\Lenovo Legion Toolkit.exe"

echo.
echo Application launched! Please test the following:
echo.
echo 1. Check UI Responsiveness:
echo    - Does the UI feel smooth and responsive?
echo    - Are animations smooth without stuttering?
echo    - Do controls respond instantly?
echo.
echo 2. Check CPU Usage in Task Manager:
echo    - Idle CPU should be ^<1%%
echo    - Active CPU should be ^<3%%
echo.
echo 3. Check Dashboard:
echo    - Open Dashboard page
echo    - Observe updates for 1 minute
echo    - Should update smoothly without freezing
echo.
echo 4. Check Memory Stability:
echo    - Leave running for 10 minutes
echo    - Memory should stabilize (not continuously grow)
echo.
